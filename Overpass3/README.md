# Port Scan

Using `nmap` I was able to identify ports ***21***, ***22*** and ***80*** as open.

A detailed nmap scan revealed some more information about the target's open ports.

# Directory Enumeration

Enumerating directories with `gobuster` showed some potentially interesting directories.

![Directory Enumeration](/Overpass3/images/Directory_Enumeration.png)

# Web Appliaction

Following the given IP address gives a homepage of Overpass hosting.

![Webpage Index](/Overpass3/images/Webpage_Index.png)

There also is a `backups` directory containing a zip file.

![Backups Directory](/Overpass3/images/Backups.png)

# Backup Analysis

The zip file contails encrypted `CustomerDetails.xlsx.gpg` file alongside with the private key for decryption.

![Zip Contents](/Overpass3/images/Zip_Contents.png)

I have imported the GPG private key with `gpg --import priv.key` command and then decrypted the spreadsheet file with GPG.

![Decrypted](/Overpass3/images/Decrypted.png)

This spreadsheet file contains ***3*** customers and their account details, including usernames and passwords.

![Spreadsheet](/Overpass3/images/Spreadsheet.png)

# FTP Login

Using one of the user's credentials I was able to log into the server via FTP. The FTP directory gave access to the files of Overpass webpage and the same backup.zip file that is already found.

![FTP Login](/Overpass3/images/FTP_Login.png)

From the directory listing it could be told that this webserver directory is writable by me. Which means that I can upload it there, execute it from the webpage and get a reverse shell running on my system.

First I set up a netcat listener.

![Netcat Listener](/Overpass3/images/Netcat_Listener.png)

Then I upload the PHP reverse shell to the webserver via FTP.

![Reverse Shell Upload](/Overpass3/images/Reverse_Shell_Upload.png)

Then I enter the full path to the reverse shell into the browser and get the connection to the target on my listener.

![Successful Access](/Overpass3/images/Successful_Access.png)

Using `find` command I was able to figure out that the ***web flag*** is in `/usr/share/httpd/web.flag` directory.

![Web Flag](/Overpass3/images/Web_Flag.png)

# Shell Stabilization

More information about shell stabilization can be found [here](https://jasonturley.xyz/how-to-stabilize-a-reverse-shell/)

1. Spawn a tty using Python:

```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```

2. Background it with Ctrl+Z:

```
CTRL^Z
```

3. Disable text display on the attacker machine and switch to the foregrounded process:

```
stty raw -echo && fg
```

4. Set terminal evironment:

```
export TERM=xterm-256-color
```

# System Enumeration

`/home` directory listing shows that users `james` and `paradox` are on the system. Since I have the password for paradox, I tried to switch to paradox user and it was successful.

Using FTP, I put `Linpeas` to the target's webserver directory.

![Linpeas Upload](/Overpass3/images/Linpeas_Upload.png)

Copied Linpeas to `/tmp` directory and executed it.

Linpeas scan shows that the user `james` has an insecure NFS configuration.

```
[i] https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/nfs-no_root_squash-misconfiguration-pe
/home/james *(rw,fsid=0,sync,no_root_squash,insecure)
```

The given link shows exploitation steps.

# NFS Exploit

Issuing `showmount` command on my local machine shows that I am unable to access the share on the target machine.

![NFS Mount](/Overpass3/images/NFS_Mount.png)

This means that the share can only be accessed locally as user `james`. For that ***SSH port forwarding*** will be used.

## SSH Port Forwarding

Firstly, I will create a SSH key on my local machine with `ssh-keygen`.

![SSH Key Creation](/Overpass3/images/SSH_Key_Creation.png)

Then I will copy the output of `paradox.pub` to the directory `authorized_keys` on  ***remote machine***

```
(remote machine)
echo <paradox.pub output here> >> /home/paradox/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

In the next step, open a new terminal and SSH into the remote system.

![SSH Login](/Overpass3/images/SSH_Login.png)

Then check which ports are used for listening to NFS connections with `rpcinfo -p` command.

![RPC Info](/Overpass3/images/RPC_Info.png)

Now it is time for actual port forwarding. By using the `-L` flag I will bind the NFS port to my SSH connection, so that all the traffic sent to the SSH daemon would be redirected to the NFS, enabling me to access the share.

![Port Forwarding](/Overpass3/images/Port_Forwarding.png)

## NFS Mount

Now I will open a new terminal on my ***local*** machine and create a folder to mount NFS share.

After the share is mounted, I will ***copy*** the `paradox.pub` file to the ***share's*** `.ssh/authorized_keys` folder and SSH into the target as james.


![Login As James](/Overpass3/images/Login_As_James.png)

After mounting the share, I can read the user flag.

![Login As James](/Overpass3/images/Login_As_James.png)

# Privillege Escalation

For privillege escalation, on the remote machine I will copy the `/bin/bash` executable to the james' home folder.

Then I will open a new terminal and on my local machine I will head to nfs directory and change both ownership and permissions of the bash executable.

![Bash Permissions](/Overpass3/images/Bash_Permissions.png)

Lastly, I will execute `./bash -p` on the remote machine as james. And it gives the root shell.

![Root Shell](/Overpass3/images/Root_Shell.png)

Now heading to `/root` directory and reading the `root.flag` file gives the root flag.

![Root Flag](/Overpass3/images/Root_Flag.png)

# Summary

1. Port scanning, which revealed 3 open ports.
2. Directory enumeration showed a directory with an accessible backup archive.
3. Inside the archive there was an encrypted spreadsheet file, which contained user credentials.
4. One of the user had FTP access.
5. When connected via FTP, a writable FTP folder allowed to upload a reverse shell and gain shell access to the system.
6. Stabilized the shell and switched to paradox user.
7. Found an insecure NFS configuration using Linpeas.
8. Successfully executed SSH port forwarding and mounted the NFS share locally.
9. Copied a local /bin/bash executable to the share and changed it's ownership and permissions.
10. Successfully obtained root shell.

Done!
