# Webpage

The webpage shows and image of anime characters and some hints about the hacking task.

![Webpage](/Bounty_Hacker/images/Webpage.png)

# Directory Enumeration

The directory scan had shown images directory, which basically holds the image seen in the main page.

![Directory Enumeration](/Bounty_Hacker/images/Directory_Enumeration.png)

# FTP Login

The ftp service running on the machine is allowing anonymous login.

![Anonymous Login](/Bounty_Hacker/images/Anonymous_Login.png)

This directory has two text files - `locks.txt` and `task.txt`.

![FTP Files](/Bounty_Hacker/images/FTP_Files.png)

The FTP server was occasionally entering Extended Passive Mode, but eventually I was able to download both files to my
local machine.

Reading the task.txt file shows the name of the list creator.

![Task List](/Bounty_Hacker/images/Task_List.png)

This name might be used to log into ssh. As for password, `locks.txt` file contains possible ssh password values.

# SSH Bruteforce

Knowing the username and having a password list I can brute force ssh login using `hydra`. The attempt was succesful.

![Hydra Scan](/Bounty_Hacker/images/Hydra_Scan.png)

Using the found credentials I logged into the system via ssh.

![SSH Login](/Bounty_Hacker/images/SSH_Login.png)

When logged in, user flag could be found.

![User Flag](/Bounty_Hacker/images/User_Flag.png)

# Privillege Escalation

Issuing `sudo -l` command shows that the user can run `/bin/tar` command as root.

![Root Command](/Bounty_Hacker/images/Root_Command.png)

Searching GTFOBins for tar exploits shows how to spawn an interactive system shell.

![GTFOBins Exploit](/Bounty_Hacker/images/GTFOBins_Exploit.png)

Since I can run tar as root, with this I could spawn a root shell.

![Root Shell](/Bounty_Hacker/images/Root_Shell.png)

Going to the `/root` directory and reading `root.txt` file gives root flag.

# Conclusion

1. Port scan showed that the target system has 3 services running.
2. FTP service allowed anonymous login.
3. Inside the FTP server, there was two text files - one file had an username for SSH. THe other file contained a password list.
4. Using Hydra and the found password list I brute forced the correct password for the user.
5. When connected as this found user, I read the user flag.
6. The user on the system could run `tar` binary as root.
7. Found GTFOBins exploit to spawn a root shell using tar binary.
8. Exploited tar and got root shell. Went to `/root` directory and read the root flag.

Done!
