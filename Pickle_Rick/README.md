# Directory Enumeration

Firstly, I had conducted a `gobuster` scan against the target with `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` list provided to it.

The scan found an accessible `/assets` directory (status code 301).

Then I used `nikto` tool to scan the webserver.

The scan found Admin login page at `/login.php`. Also, robots.txt does not contain any disallow entries.

The login page had a broken CSS, but login procedure worked.

Reloading page for a few times fixed the CSS.

# Login Credentials

Inspecting the source code of the page revealed the username to login with.

I have tried to guess the password by entering some common values to the password field, but no luck there.

Next I decided to check the `robots.txt` file. This file contained a single string - a reference to Rick and Morty show and also the ***password*** for the previously found user.

These credentials gave access to `Rick Portal`.

# First Ingredient

As of now, only Command Panel section could be accessed. This panel accepted shell commands.

Issuing `ls` command showed `Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt` file.

When I tried `cat` command in the Command Panel,`Command disabled` error was shown.

***Less*** command did the trick though and the first ingredient was shown.

There was also `clue.txt` file that told to look around the file system for the other ingredient.

# Second Ingredient

Looking at `/home/rick` directory the `second ingredients` file was found.

![Second ingredient](/Pickle_Rick/images/Second_ingredient.png)

Opening this file with `less` command gave the second ingredient.

# Third ingredient

Lastly, it was neccessary to find the third ingredient for Rick.
One interesting directory to look at was the `/root` directory. One problem - this folder was only accessible by the root user.
For that purpose I had checked what commands the current user could run as root with `sudo -l`.

![Run permissions](/Pickle_Rick/images/Run_permissions.png)

Turned out that the current user could run ***any*** commands as root ***without*** password!

![Root listing](/Pickle_Rick/images/Root_listing.png)

Listing contents of /root showed `3rd.txt` file.

Viewing the 3rd.txt with `less` command gave the third ingredient.

Challenge solved!

# Extra

The source code of Command panel had a ***Base64*** encoded string which, when decoded for several times, gave a two-word phrase, `rabbit hole`, which I had not used in solving this CTF, but thought it was a fun thing to add.
